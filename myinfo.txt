Communication is the way by which different devices interact with each other. Firstly it was wired communication. Then wireless communication was introduced. Radio waves were used to make communications. As time passed, more bandwidth and more cost efficient ideas were proposed, because the number of internet users in increasing at a good rate day by day. At that time, Visible Light Communication (VLC) Technology came which is better than traditional Radio waves used in communication. VLC can be a better choice than Radio wave because of its high rate of data transmission, cost efficiency, maintenance.  It is not so far that all Lamp posts of roads will work as data transmission medium, cars will communicate among them by LED headlights, using high speed internet sitting on a transport. In many critical places where radio wave can’t work (like under water communication) will be replaced by VLC Technology. Bandwidth price can be reduced a lot which will make rural area people connected to internet. Home appliances will become smarter; they will communicate with each other to make our daily tasks easier and secure. In medical science the impact of Radio wave on human body can be avoided by using VLC technology which will help a lot to inspect and implement new ideas.
